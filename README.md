## Learn Thai by speaking

Learn Thai for free by translating simple sentences. The idea is to learn one sentence every day, props to [New](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_WZPWphsvhjszQp6E9U18Q) for the idea. By the way, visit her YouTube channel; it's worth it. 

## ✨ Points

For every sentence, you get 1 point. I personally add 100 points on my daily practice, that is equivalent to 100 spoken correct sentences per day. 

## 🎓 Sentences learnt

The app counts the number of unique sentences learnt so far. 

## 👻 Shortcuts

You can use your keyboard to navigate through the app quicker. Press `f` to find a sentence, `n` to skip the current one, `enter` to hear the pronunciation and `spacebar` to start/stop recording.

## Note

It's recommended to use Google Chrome 91 (or higher) desktop version. This guarantees the best user experience. In mobile devices there is no guarantee that the app works properly (feel free to contribute if you know why it doesn't work).
