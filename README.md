## Learn Thai by speaking

Learn Thai for free by translating simple sentences. The idea is to learn one sentence every day, props to [New](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_WZPWphsvhjszQp6E9U18Q) for the idea. By the way, visit her YouTube channel; it's worth it. 

## âœ¨ Points

For every sentence, you get 1 point. I add 100 points to my daily practice, which is equivalent to 100 spoken correct sentences per day. 

## ðŸŽ“ Sentences learned

The app counts the number of unique sentences learned so far. 

## ðŸ‘» Shortcuts

You can use your keyboard to navigate through the app quicker. Press `f` to find a sentence, `n` to skip the current one, `enter` to hear the pronunciation, and `spacebar` to start/stop recording.

## Note

It's recommended to use Google Chrome 91 (or higher) desktop version. This guarantees the best user experience. On mobile devices, there is no guarantee that the app works properly (feel free to contribute if you know why it doesn't work).
